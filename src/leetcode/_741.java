/**
 * LeetCode 741 - Cherry Pickup
 * <p>
 * Very good DP problem.
 * The original problem can be viewed as two person simultaneously go from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner,
 * where the cherry on the same cell can only be picked up once.
 * <p>
 * Let these two people walk in the SAME speed. Then a very critical observation is that if the two people meet at some
 * location, they must spend the same amount of time.
 * So, we can define f[t][i][j] as the max # of cherries the two people can pick, where
 * 1) they have walked t steps, and at the end,
 * 2) the first people is at the i-th row,
 * 3) the second people is at the j-th row.
 * The column indices can be computed accordingly.
 * <p>
 * The DP recurrence can be found in the following code.
