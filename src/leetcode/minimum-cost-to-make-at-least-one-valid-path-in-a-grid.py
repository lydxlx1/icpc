"""1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

Shortest Path

Build the graph
- For each grid cell, create four directed edges to its neighbors (if exist).
- The weight of the edge is 0 if the edge direction matches with the number in cell, otherwise the weight is 1.
  This means each cell will have exactly one outgoing edge with 0 weight, and two or three outgoing edges with weight equal to 1.
- Then, the length of the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right will be the answer.


Time: O(mn log (mn)), which can be further optimized to O(mn).
      This is because weights of edges in this graph are either 0 or 1, so we can compute the shortest path using BFS with a Deque.
      Formally, we insert to the head of the queue if the edge weight is 0 and insert to the tail of the queue if weight is 1.
Space: O(mn)
