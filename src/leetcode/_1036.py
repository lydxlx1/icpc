LeetCode 1036 - Escape a Large Maze

DFS

We only need to check whether source is completely contained inside a closed blocker region so it is isolated
from the target, or vice versa.

Although the maze is quite big, there are at most 200 blockers. Therefore, we could just perform a DFS
on a grid that is slightly bigger than 400 * 400 and centered at source.

If we could reach target from source inside the grid, then there is clearly a solution.
If we could reach the boundary of this grid, that means source is not blocked these blockers.
Otherwise, source is blocked and isolated from target, so there is no solution.

We then do the same thing from target.
If neither source nor target is blocked and isolated from each other, then it is not hard to construct
a path as the maze is sufficient large.
