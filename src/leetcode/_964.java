/**
 * LeetCode 964 - Least Operators to Express Number
 *
 * Some notes:
 * - No parentheses are allowed => sum of a list of positive/negative power of x's.
 * - # of operators = # of numbers - 1, where # of numbers is a bit more clear to compute.
 * - Start from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, and we have two choices for each non-zero
 *   powers, i.e., straightforward addition or subtraction with a borrow from the higher bit.
 * - What is the time complexity?
 *   - Assume the target number is n, and we want to compute its time complexity f(n).
 *   - We have two subproblems in the recursion, and the size of each subproblem is n / x.
 *     Remaining cost in the recursion is O(1).
 *   - By Master Theorem, when x > 2, it is clear that f(n) = O(log n).
 *   - When x = 2, looks like f(n) could be linear, but it is not.
 *     One can draw some examples first to feel the complexity.
